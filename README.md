# Acoustic-Analogue-of-Pulsar-Array
- Demonstrated an ”Acoustic Analogue of Galactic Scale Gravitational Wave Detector”, i.e., a pulsar array
- Used correlation analysis to obtain and understand normalised residues of acoustic signals of metronomes
- Tested the theory on a physical system of metronomes, obtaining accurate results
